# Installer source and release hold

The self-extracting `.run` includes shell code from `installer_header.sh`,
`installer_core.sh`, and `init/*.in`. A binary release must ship the exact
installer source from the commit used to build that `.run`, in addition to
the AstraX, Go, SRT, libdvbcsa, x/text, patch, and notice sources recorded
in its payload. The public source snapshot alone is not the corresponding
source package for the frozen Linux executable.

The frozen executable was built from AstraX source commit `6544bd0`.
`recipient_build.py` accepts its hash-pinned source stage and offers two
non-serving build modes: `--output` retains the private QA preflight, while
`--recipient-output` can run as an ordinary non-root user on Linux amd64.
It uses staged source archives and a local Go module proxy; it never runs
the candidate executable. A separate Go 1.26.9 toolchain and Ubuntu 24.04
amd64 build dependencies (Python 3, C/C++ compiler, CMake, make, patch,
dpkg-source, pkg-config and OpenSSL 3 development files) are required.

From an extracted held layout, with the prerequisites already installed:

```sh
python3 -B share/build/recipient_build.py share/source --check-only
python3 -B share/build/recipient_build.py share/source \
  --recipient-output /absolute/path/to/new-build-directory
```

The output directory must not exist and remains private to the invoking
user. A rebuild need not match the frozen ELF byte for byte; compare its
source, build metadata, ABI, and behavior instead. The recipient mode has
source-only tests, not a native recipient-build acceptance run. Do not
relabel or modify a held layout in place to imply distribution readiness.

`build_run.py` refuses a distributable package unless `candidate_qualified`,
`distribution_cleared`, and `publication_cleared` are all true and
source/notice closure is complete. `--qa-extract-only` makes a non-installing
verification package from a held payload. `--private-install-qa` requires
an explicitly held, qualified layout and produces a mode-0600 package named
`PRIVATE-INSTALL-QA`. That package requires
`ASTRAX_PRIVATE_INSTALL_QA_ACK=1` for `--install` and always refuses
`--activate`; it is for an isolated disposable root only, not distribution
or production use.
